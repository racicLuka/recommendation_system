  <h2>Couple of words about the challenge</h2>
  
  <p>
    I gave it my all, really pushed myself to do the best I could. But I'll admit, there were bits and pieces where I know I could've done better.
  </p>

  <p>
    I didn't have much experience with certain requirements, like security stuff. It was all a bit new to me, to be honest. <br>
    But I hustled through, trying to figure it out as best I could.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm open to any feedback! I know there's always room to improve, and I'm totally up for learning from this. <br>
    Thanks for giving me the chance to dive into this challengeâ€”I've definitely learned a bunch.
  </p>

  <p>
    I really hope that you will see the potential that I hold and that you give me a chance to help.
